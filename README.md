I always wanted my cells to appear in the cell stage. Well your in luck because this mod adds random user created cells to the cell stage.


Features

All cells act differently depending on the level they spawn in.
Each game spawn's different cells.
The cells don't drop loot to keep the game balanced.
There are 5 personalities a cell can have.
It doesn't yet support cells made with the secret cell editor.


Installing

Steam Install path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spore\DataEP1
If you don't have the DataEP1 folder put the mod in the Data folder instead.


Removing

You can just delete the SG's_UserCellAdder.package file.
